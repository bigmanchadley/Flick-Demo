# Flick-Demo
A 2D top-down drifting game made in Godot!
Work in progress, updates to low-speed handling and pixel-art levels coming soon!
# Motivation
- Free flowing physics based movement is awesome!
- A drifting game that is focused on racing and time attacks instead of the arcade style "points for drifting"
- Why no local-multiplayer in drifting games?
- To learn about physics programming and how to put together the different pieces required in game dev: player-control/art/levels/sound
# Quick Start
To play the game: Download the zip and open the application.

# Code Samples
There are 2 code sample in the repo
- car_script.gd : houses the player input and physics movement
- manager.gd    : instantiates objects into the scene and controls the different systems (lap times, finish line, etc.)
